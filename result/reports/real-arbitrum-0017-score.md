# DAO Proposal Semantic Gap Audit Report

**Generated At**: 2026-05-08 11:15:23 UTC
**Proposal ID**: 13108804573775967668959825241666341617107666532012387058509418598838035461528
**Simulation Status**: reverted_with_trace
**Trace Source**: simulated_trace

---

## Consistency Score

**Overall Score**: 8/10
**Risk Level**: LOW
**Scoring Method**: worst-case risk gating, not weighted average.

Overall score uses minimum dimension score 8 capped by highest severity LOW.

---

## Conflict Detection

- Dimension score: 8/10
- Severity: LOW
- Summary: Trace includes undisclosed execution path components without extracted risk actions.

### Unaccounted Addresses
- `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064`
  - Risk level: LOW
  - Related actions: unable to confirm
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.
- `0x34d45e99f7d8c45ed05b5ca72d54bbd1fb3f98f0`
  - Risk level: LOW
  - Related actions: unable to confirm
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.

### Key Findings
- Unaccounted trace addresses
  - Risk level: LOW
  - Description: One or more addresses appeared in the trace without direct proposal text disclosure.
  - Evidence source: trace

---

## Depth Analysis

- Claimed complexity: complex
- Actual max depth: 0
- Depth mismatch: no
- Delegatecall count: 0

Summary: Core business actions match proposal text; observed wrapper depth is within a normal review range.

---

## Function Semantic Match

- Dimension score: 10/10
- Severity: LOW
- Summary: No deterministic business action was extracted from the trace.
- Claimed actions: upgrade
- Actual actions: unable to confirm

### Matched Functions
- `sendTxToL1(address,bytes)`

---

## Potential Risk Findings

### 1. LOW - Unaccounted trace addresses

- **Severity**: LOW
- **Description**: One or more addresses appeared in the trace without direct proposal text disclosure.
- **Evidence Source**: trace
- **Confidence**: 0.9
- **Recommendation**: Review undisclosed execution path components, but prioritize whether the core business action remains covered by proposal text.
- **Key Evidence**:
  - Unaccounted addresses: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064, 0x34d45e99f7d8c45ed05b5ca72d54bbd1fb3f98f0

---

## Security Conclusion

The proposal text and the observed payload effects are broadly consistent. No clear Semantic Gap was found. Reviewers should still manually review any low-risk undisclosed addresses or unknown selectors.

---

## Summary

The proposal text claims: This Constitutional AIP proposes to upgrade Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to ArbOS 40 "Callisto", which includes relevant Ethereum Execution Layer changes from the Pectra upgrade (EIP-7702, EIP-2537, EIP-2935) and a minor fix for Arbitrum Stylus.
The payload actually shows: unable to confirm. Decoded functions include: sendTxToL1(address,bytes).
The most important scoring issue is `conflict_detection`, which scored 8/10.
No HIGH or CRITICAL finding was generated. Unknown or unclear fields should still be manually reviewed.

## Machine-Verifiable Controls

- LLM used for scoring: false
- LLM used for trace analysis: false
- Unsupported claims allowed: false
- Unknown fields preserved as unknown: true

This report is generated from structured rule-engine output and a deterministic template. The LLM is only used for proposal-text semantic extraction and is not used for scoring, trace analysis, or final conclusions.
