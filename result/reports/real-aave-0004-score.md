# DAO Proposal Semantic Gap Audit Report

**Generated At**: 2026-05-08 11:15:23 UTC
**Proposal ID**: 100
**Simulation Status**: success
**Trace Source**: simulated_trace

## Consistency Score

**Overall Score**: 2/10
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Scoring Method**: worst-case risk gating, not weighted average.

Overall score uses minimum dimension score 2 capped by highest severity CRITICAL.

Some dimensions may be acceptable, but the overall score is limited by High or Critical rule-engine findings.

## Conflict Detection

- Dimension score: 4/10
- Severity: HIGH
- Summary: An undisclosed address participates in an uncovered high-risk business action.

### Addresses Disclosed In Proposal Text
- `0x5d37e4b374e6907de8fc7fb33ee3b0af403c7403`
- `0xd417d07c20e31f6e129fa68182054b641fbec8bd`

### Unaccounted Addresses
- `0x158a6bc04f0828318821bae797f50b0a1299d45b`
  - Risk level: HIGH
  - Related actions: sendMessageToChild(address,bytes)
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.
- `0x28e4f3a7f651294b9564800b2d01f35189a5bfbe`
  - Risk level: HIGH
  - Related actions: unable to confirm
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.
- `0xec568fffba86c094cf06b22134b23074dfe2252c`
  - Risk level: HIGH
  - Related actions: unable to confirm
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.
- `0xfe5e5d361b2ad62c541bab87c45a0b9b018389a2`
  - Risk level: HIGH
  - Related actions: sendMessageToChild(address,bytes)
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.

### Key Findings
- Unaccounted trace addresses
  - Risk level: HIGH
  - Description: One or more addresses appeared in the trace without direct proposal text disclosure.
  - Evidence source: trace

---

## Depth Analysis

- Claimed complexity: simple
- Actual max depth: 2
- Depth mismatch: no
- Delegatecall count: 0

Summary: Observed trace depth is consistent with the claimed complexity.

---

## Function Semantic Match

- Dimension score: 2/10
- Severity: CRITICAL
- Summary: Text claims a low-risk action while the trace includes a sensitive business action.
- Claimed actions: parameter_update, parameter_update, parameter_update, parameter_update
- Actual actions: bridge

### Matched Functions
- `execute(address)`
- `sendMessageToChild(address,bytes)`
- `syncState(address,bytes)`

### Unmatched Or Additional Actions
- `bridge`
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Note: this action was not fully matched to the claimed proposal action. Review the linked evidence before relying on the proposal text.

### Key Findings
- Claimed actions do not fully match trace actions
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Description: Text claims a low-risk action while the trace includes a sensitive business action.
  - Evidence source: rule_engine

---

## Potential Risk Findings

### 1. HIGH - Unaccounted trace addresses

- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Description**: One or more addresses appeared in the trace without direct proposal text disclosure.
- **Evidence Source**: trace
- **Confidence**: 0.9
- **Recommendation**: Review whether the proposal text sufficiently discloses the business action and its counterparty.
- **Key Evidence**:
  - Unaccounted addresses: 0x158a6bc04f0828318821bae797f50b0a1299d45b, 0x28e4f3a7f651294b9564800b2d01f35189a5bfbe, 0xec568fffba86c094cf06b22134b23074dfe2252c, 0xfe5e5d361b2ad62c541bab87c45a0b9b018389a2

### 2. CRITICAL - Claimed actions do not fully match trace actions

- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Description**: Text claims a low-risk action while the trace includes a sensitive business action.
- **Evidence Source**: rule_engine
- **Confidence**: 0.9
- **Recommendation**: Compare proposal action wording with decoded functions and risk actions before relying on the text.
- **Key Evidence**:
  - Action comparison: claimed=parameter_update, parameter_update, parameter_update, parameter_update, actual=unable to confirm

## Security Conclusion

The proposal has a critical Semantic Gap or potential attack indicators. The textual commitment and observed on-chain behavior are severely inconsistent. Do not execute without immediate manual security review.

---

## Summary

The proposal text claims: Lists MaticX on the Aave v3 Polygon Pool as collateral, configuring risk parameters, interest rate strategies, eMode settings, and a 6M supply cap.
The payload actually shows: bridge. Decoded functions include: execute(address), sendMessageToChild(address,bytes), syncState(address,bytes).
The most important scoring issue is `function_semantic_match`, which scored 2/10.
High-risk findings include: Unaccounted trace addresses, Claimed actions do not fully match trace actions. Pausing or escalating to manual audit is recommended.

## Machine-Verifiable Controls

- LLM used for scoring: false
- LLM used for trace analysis: false
- Unsupported claims allowed: false
- Unknown fields preserved as unknown: true

This report is generated from structured rule-engine output and a deterministic template. The LLM is only used for proposal-text semantic extraction and is not used for scoring, trace analysis, or final conclusions.
