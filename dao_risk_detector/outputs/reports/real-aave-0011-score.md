# DAO Proposal Semantic Gap Audit Report

**Generated At**: 2026-05-08 11:15:23 UTC
**Proposal ID**: 164
**Simulation Status**: success
**Trace Source**: simulated_trace

## Consistency Score

**Overall Score**: 2/10
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Scoring Method**: worst-case risk gating, not weighted average.

Overall score uses minimum dimension score 2 capped by highest severity CRITICAL.

Some dimensions may be acceptable, but the overall score is limited by High or Critical rule-engine findings.

## Conflict Detection

- Dimension score: 2/10
- Severity: CRITICAL
- Summary: An undisclosed address participates in an uncovered critical business action.

### Addresses Disclosed In Proposal Text
- `0x6bce15b789e537f3aba3c60cb183f0e8737f05ec`

### Unaccounted Addresses
- `0x25ace71c97b33cc4729cf772ae268934f7ab5fa1`
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Related actions: sendMessage(address,bytes,uint32)
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.
- `0x5e4e65926ba27467555eb562121fac00d24e9dd2`
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Related actions: unable to confirm
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.
- `0x5f5c02875a8e9b5a26fbd09040abcfdeb2aa6711`
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Related actions: sendMessage(address,bytes,uint32)
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.

  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.
- `0xde1fcfb0851916ca5101820a69b13a4e276bd81f`
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Related actions: unable to confirm
  - Evidence source: trace

- `0xec568fffba86c094cf06b22134b23074dfe2252c`
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Related actions: unable to confirm
  - Evidence source: trace
  - Note: this address was not explicitly disclosed in the proposal text. If the system cannot verify its role, manual review is required.

### Key Findings
- Unaccounted trace addresses
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Description: One or more addresses appeared in the trace without direct proposal text disclosure.
  - Evidence source: trace

---

## Depth Analysis

- Claimed complexity: moderate
- Actual max depth: 3
- Depth mismatch: no
- Delegatecall count: 1

Summary: Observed trace depth is consistent with the claimed complexity.

---

## Function Semantic Match

- Dimension score: 2/10
- Severity: CRITICAL
- Summary: Text claims a low-risk action while the trace includes a sensitive business action.
- Claimed actions: parameter_update
- Actual actions: bridge

### Matched Functions
- `enqueue(address,uint256,bytes)`
- `enqueueL2GasPrepaid()`
- `execute(address)`
- `getAddress(string)`
- `getQueueLength()`
- `sendMessage(address,bytes,uint32)`

### Unmatched Or Additional Actions
- `bridge`
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Note: this action was not fully matched to the claimed proposal action. Review the linked evidence before relying on the proposal text.

### Key Findings
- Claimed actions do not fully match trace actions
  - Risk level: CRITICAL
  - Description: Text claims a low-risk action while the trace includes a sensitive business action.
  - Evidence source: rule_engine

## Potential Risk Findings

### 1. CRITICAL - Unaccounted trace addresses

- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Description**: One or more addresses appeared in the trace without direct proposal text disclosure.
- **Evidence Source**: trace
- **Confidence**: 0.9
- **Recommendation**: Pause or escalate manual review because an uncovered critical business action is linked to an undisclosed address.
- **Key Evidence**:
  - Unaccounted addresses: 0x25ace71c97b33cc4729cf772ae268934f7ab5fa1, 0x5e4e65926ba27467555eb562121fac00d24e9dd2, 0x5f5c02875a8e9b5a26fbd09040abcfdeb2aa6711, 0xd9166833ff12a5f900ccfbf2c8b62a90f1ca1fd5, 0xde1fcfb0851916ca5101820a69b13a4e276bd81f, 0xec568fffba86c094cf06b22134b23074dfe2252c

### 2. CRITICAL - Claimed actions do not fully match trace actions

- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Description**: Text claims a low-risk action while the trace includes a sensitive business action.
- **Evidence Source**: rule_engine
- **Confidence**: 0.9
- **Recommendation**: Compare proposal action wording with decoded functions and risk actions before relying on the text.
- **Key Evidence**:
  - Action comparison: claimed=parameter_update, actual=unable to confirm

## Security Conclusion

The proposal has a critical Semantic Gap or potential attack indicators. The textual commitment and observed on-chain behavior are severely inconsistent. Do not execute without immediate manual security review.

---

## Summary

The proposal text claims: A proposal by Gauntlet to update risk parameters on the Aave V3 Optimism market, based on regular recommendations to balance insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage.
The payload actually shows: bridge. Decoded functions include: enqueue(address,uint256,bytes), enqueueL2GasPrepaid(), execute(address), getAddress(string), getQueueLength(), sendMessage(address,bytes,uint32).
The most important scoring issue is `conflict_detection`, which scored 2/10.
High-risk findings include: Unaccounted trace addresses, Claimed actions do not fully match trace actions. Pausing or escalating to manual audit is recommended.

## Machine-Verifiable Controls

- LLM used for scoring: false
- LLM used for trace analysis: false
- Unsupported claims allowed: false
- Unknown fields preserved as unknown: true

This report is generated from structured rule-engine output and a deterministic template. The LLM is only used for proposal-text semantic extraction and is not used for scoring, trace analysis, or final conclusions.
